### Slack Chat

Several Samvera Partners use Slack within their institutions for team communication and collaboration. There is a Samvera Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Anyone can create a new channel within the Samvera Slack team once they have registered for an account.

Avalon Slack team: [samvera.slack.com/messages/avalon/](https://samvera.slack.com/messages/avalon/)

Joining a Slack team requires an invitation, but anyone can generate an automatic invite to the Samvera slack channel using the following form: [http://bit.ly/2aDFtLO](http://bit.ly/2aDFtLO)
