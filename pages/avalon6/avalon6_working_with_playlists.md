## Introduction

## Playlist Visibility and Sharing

Playlists have one of three different levels of visibility:

* _Public_ : accessible to anyone, even unauthenticated users.
* _Private_ : accessible only to the playlist creator.
* _Share by link_ : accessible only through a generated unique URL.

To share a playlist:

1. Select the Playlist feature. 
2. Select the playlist to be shared from the list of playlists.
3. Click the "Share" button to display the playlist URL.
4. Copy the URL and provide it to others to grant access to the playlist.

A public playlist's URL is static and can be accessed through the browser's address bar. In contrast, a playlist with "Share by link" visibility generates a unique URL granting temporary access. If necessary, a new URL can be generated when editing playlists:

1. Follow steps 1 & 2 for Editing Playlist Details (above).
2. Click "Get New Link" and confirm.

The old URL for the playlist will no longer provide access.

## Playlist Tags

### Example Tag Usage

Tags can help users organize and categorize multiple playlists. Because tags are defined by the user, they can be adapted for a variety of needs. For example, tags could be used to categorize playlists in the following ways:

* Format - audio, video
* Content - music, spoken-word, documentary
* Subject or genre - classical, jazz, comedy, action
* Chronologically - 18th century, 19th century, 2000s
* Use - fall 2018, course (x)
* Etc.

Playlists can support any number of tags simultaneously. In addition to categorizing a playlist, tags provide a shorthand description of a playlist when describing the content using full text may be inappropriate or cumbersome.

### Adding Tags to Playlists

Tags are attached to playlists at the time of their creation, but they can also be added or removed later by editing the playlist details. To add or edit a playlist's tags, see either of the above sections for "Creating a Playlist" or "Editing Playlist Details".

### Filtering Playlists Using Tags

A user's list of playlists can be filtered by tag, using the filter menu located in the Playlist feature. The menu will display all of a user's tags that have been attached to any playlist--select one of the tags to filter the result.
