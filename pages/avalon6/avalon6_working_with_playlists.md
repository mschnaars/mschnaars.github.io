* _Playlist item_: a range of time from a section of a media object added to a user's playlist
* _Tag_: a label attached to a playlist for organization or identification

## Playlist Visibility and Sharing

Playlists have one of three different levels of visibility:

* _Public_: accessible to anyone, even unauthenticated users.
* _Private_: accessible only to the playlist creator.
* _Share by link_: accessible only through a generated unique URL.

To share a playlist:

1. Select the Playlist feature. 
2. Select the playlist to be shared from the list of playlists.
3. Click the "Share" button to display the playlist URL.
4. Copy the URL and provide it to others to grant access to the playlist.

A public playlist's URL is static and can be accessed through the browser's address bar. In contrast, a playlist with "Share by link" visibility generates a unique URL granting temporary access. If necessary, a new URL can be generated when editing playlists:

1. Follow steps 1 & 2 for Editing Playlist Details (above).
2. Click "Get New Link" and confirm.

The old URL for the playlist will no longer provide access.
