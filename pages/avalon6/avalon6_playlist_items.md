Playlists in Avalon are limited to authenticated users only.

### Definitions

* _Playlist_ : a collection of playlist items.
* _Playlist item_ : a range of time from a section of a media object added to a user's playlist
* _Tag_ : a label attached to a playlist for organization or identification

## Adding Items to Playlists

2. Select Add to Playlist {% include inline_image.html file="icons/add_to_playlist.png" %} in the media player.
3. In the dropdown, alter any of the following fields:
   * _Title_ : customize this item's title that displays in the playlist.
   * _Playlist_ : select a playlist for this item, or create a new playlist for this item.
   * _Start_ : edit the timestamp marking the beginning of this item's playback.

## Using Markers

Markers locate specific timestamps in a media object; they are similar to bookmarks used in other applications. Markers can only be added while viewing playlist items within a playlist, and they can only be added by the playlist creator. 

To add a marker:

1. Select Add Marker {% include inline_image.html file="icons/marker.png" %}.
2. Add a title to the marker.
3. Adjust the timestamp offset, if necessary.
4. Click "Add".

Markers can be edited or deleted by using the drop-down list of markers when viewing the playlist item. If the playlist's visibility is shareable (by link or public), markers will be usable by other viewers.

## Editing Playlist Items

1. Select the Playlist feature.
2. Click the "Edit" button for the respective playlist.
3. Edit playlist items in the following ways:
   * Drag Reorder <i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v"></i> and move an item manually to reorder individual playlist items.
   * Enter new values in the order field adjacent to Reorder <i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v"></i> to reorder all playlist items simultaneously.
   * Select an item(s) and use the "Copy to..." or "Move to..." drop-down menus to move or copy a playlist item(s) to another playlist.
   * Select Edit <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> for a playlist item to edit its Title, Start Time, End Time, or Description.
