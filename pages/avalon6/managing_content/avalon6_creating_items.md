## Creating A Single Item

1. Select __Manage Content__.

3. Select __Create an Item__.

### Manage File(s)

Files may be uploaded directly to Avalon through the web or imported from an Avalon dropbox.

To upload files through the web:

1. Choose __Select file__.
2. __Open__ a media file using the explorer.
3. If the file is a pre-encoded derivative, select __Skip Transcoding__.
4. Select __Upload__ to confirm the file.
5. If the item consists of multiple media files, repeat steps 1-4 for each file.
6. Select __Save and continue__.

To import files from an Avalon dropbox:

1. Select __Open Dropbox__.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the media file(s).
3. Select the media file(s) (audio and video files only) that make up the item.
4. If the file(s) is a pre-encoded derivative, select __Skip Transcoding__.
5. Select __Submit__.
6. Select __Save and continue__.

### Resource Description

When creating a new item in Avalon, the Resource Description form is used to provide metadata about an item. Avalon utilizes the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) for organizing descriptive metadata. Select __Help__ {% include inline_icon.html icon="help" %} to view useful guidelines 

Required metadata fields include:

__Title__
: Used for display in search results and single item views; recommended practice is to reflect the content captured in digitized media files (such as the title of the piece). Only the first 32 characters will appear in search result listings.

__Publication Date__ 
: Main publication date associated with the item to be used for sorting browse and search results. Enter date information in a format consistent with the options shown inÂ [Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) 1.0](http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/pre-submission.html).
