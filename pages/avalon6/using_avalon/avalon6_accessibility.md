## General Accessibility

* The default language (English) is declared on each page.
* The search field uses an associated label element to enhance screen reader support.
* Search terms are included at the beginning of the page titles for search result pages.
* Selected facet labels are included at the beginning of the page titles for browse result pages.
* The URL(s) provided to share specific media objects includes an appropriate title attribute.
* The "more >>" links leading to additional facet options on browse pages includes the appropriate facet label for screen readers, e.g. "more Collection >>", "more Language >>".

### Keyboard Access

Users can use the keyboard to navigate the Avalon Media System interface.

* `TAB`: move forward through each interactive element on the page (links, text fields, buttons, etc.).
* `SHIFT+TAB`: move backward through each interactive element.
* `ENTER`: trigger an element's behavior (e.g. pressing `ENTER` on a link will open the link in the browser).

When an element is focused it will be surrounded by an outline to enhance its visibility.

### Skip to Main Content

When using `TAB`, the first element of each page is a link titled "Skip to main content". This link immediately shifts focus to the main content of the page. When viewing an audio or video page, "Skip to main content" shifts focus directly to Play {% include inline_icon.html icon="play" %}.
