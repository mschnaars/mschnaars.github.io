## General Accessibility

* The default language (English) is declared on each page.
* The search field uses an associated label element to enhance screen reader support.
* Search terms are included at the beginning of the page titles for search result pages.
* Selected facet labels are included at the beginning of the page titles for browse result pages.
* The URL(s) provided to share specific media objects includes an appropriate title attribute.
* The "more >>" links leading to additional facet options on browse pages includes the appropriate facet label for screen readers, e.g. "more Collection >>", "more Language >>".

### Keyboard Access

Users can use the keyboard to navigate the Avalon Media System interface.

* `TAB`: move forward through each interactive element on the page (links, text fields, buttons, etc.).
* `SHIFT+TAB`: move backward through each interactive element.
* `ENTER`: trigger an element's behavior (e.g. pressing `ENTER` on a link will open the link in the browser).

When an element is focused it will be surrounded by an outline to enhance its visibility.

### Skip to Main Content

When using `TAB`, the first element of each page is a link titled "Skip to main content". This link immediately shifts the browser focus to the main content of the page, minimizing the number of times a user needs to press `TAB` to reach a page's most prominent elements. When viewing an audio or video page, the "Skip to main content" link shifts the browser focus directly to the Play button.
