### Get New Link

A playlist with "Share by link" visibility generates a unique URL to grant temporary access. If necessary, a new URL for the playlist can be generated, and the old URL will no longer grant access:

1. Go to __Playlists__.
2. Select __Edit__ {% include inline_icon.html icon="edit" %} for a playlist.
3. Select __Get new link__ and confirm.

## Playlist Tags

### Example Tag Usage

Tags are user-defined and adaptable for wide range of needs. For example, tags can categorize playlists in the following ways:

* _Format_ - audio, video
* _Content_ - music, spoken-word, documentary
* _Genre_ - classical, jazz, comedy, action
* _Chronologically_ - 18th century, 19th century, 2000s
* _Use_ - fall 2018, course (x)

The number of allowable tags is unlimited.

### Adding Tags to Playlists

To add, edit, or remove tags from a playlist, see the instructions for sections "Creating a Playlist" or "Editing Playlist Details".

### Filtering Playlists by Tag

1. Go to __Playlists__.
2. Select a tag from the __Filter__ list.
3. The playlist results will automatically update.
