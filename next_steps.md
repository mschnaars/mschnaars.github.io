## Documents in Progress

* managing_content/avalon6_creating_items.md
  * The first part of the doc is done, but it needs some additional information for structure and captions, resource description, and the preview page.
* managing_content/avalon6_connecting_to_a_dropbox.md
  * This page is currently empty. The information from an identical page on the confluence wiki could basically be replicated here.
* managing_content/derivative_files.md
  * This page is currently empty. The information from an identical page on the confluence wiki could basically be replicated here, but with more user-centered information and how it relates to transcoding.

## Documents for the Future

I recommend creating pages for these topics:

* How to create structure files
  * How to use the graphical editor
  * How to use the waveform editor (when it is complete)
* How to create caption files
* How to perform bulk actions
* Advanced searching and browsing (dismax and edismax, for example)

## Future Work on the Site

* Revisit the landing pages for each Avalon version; what links should be there, and should there be landing pages for each of the topics?
* Add tags to pages (may not be necessary, but worth considering)
